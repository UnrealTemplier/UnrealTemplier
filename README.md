Hi, I'm Sergey Evseev (Sehr-gay Yeff-Seh-Yeff) aka UnrealTemplier and this is my GitHub.

I am publishing here (by now mostly) exercises solutions and learning projects from books and courses that I'm reading/watching, and my pet projects as well.
My fields of interest are backend development (PHP, Python, Go), gamedev (Unreal 5, C++, renderers and engines, in the past it was a lot of Unity), programming languages and compilers, operating systems and emulators, and some retro stuff (like Apple II or NES programming).

Hi, I'm Sergey Evseev (sehr-GAY yeff-SEH-yeff) aka UnrealTemplier and this is my GitHub.

I am publishing here (by now mostly) exercise solutions and learning projects from books and courses that I read/watch, as well as my pet projects.
My fields of interest are backend development (PHP, JS/TS/Node, Go), some frontend, gamedev (Unreal 5, C++, renderers and engines, in the past it was a lot of Unity and C#), programming languages theory and compiler development, operating system and emulator development, low-level languages (C++, C and assembly languages) and some retro stuff (like Apple II, Commodore or NES programming).

Hi, I'm Sergey Evseev (Sehr-gay Yeff-Seh-Yeff) aka UnrealTemplier and this is my GitHub.

I am publishing here (by now mostly) exercises solutions and learning projects from books and courses that I'm reading/watching, and my pet projects as well.
My fields of interest are backend development (PHP, Python, Go), some frontend (CSS, JS, TS, React, Vue), gamedev (Unreal 5, C++, renderers and engines, in the past it was a lot of Unity and C#), programming languages theory and compilers development, operating systems and emulators development, low-level languages (C++, C and assembly languages) and some retro stuff (like Apple II, Commodore or NES programming).
